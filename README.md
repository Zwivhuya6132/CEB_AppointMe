UJ CBE Tutor Application Form System
Welcome to the UJ CBE Tutor Application Form System! This system has been designed to simplify the tutor application process for both users and administrators. Our primary goal is to streamline the application process and eliminate redundant data entry, saving tutors valuable time.

Key Features
Simplified Application Process: We have worked hard to make the application process as simple and user-friendly as possible. The form is intuitive and easy to navigate, ensuring a smooth experience for applicants.

Data Reuse: To minimize repetitive data entry, we will integrate with the system with UJ CBE's existing database. This way, applicants won't need to re-enter information that the school already has on file.

Cost and Time Savings: By eliminating the need for printing and scanning application forms, we are not only reducing paper waste but also saving costs for the applicants. It's a win-win situation!

Scalability and Licensing: UJ CBE has the option to license this system to other faculties, generating additional income for the institution. This scalable approach ensures that the system can benefit multiple departments while being maintained efficiently.

How It Works
User Registration: Tutors can register themselves on the platform by providing basic information.

Data Validation: The system will validate the data provided by the user and cross-check it with the existing records to avoid duplication.

Application Form: Users will have access to the tutor application form, which is designed with simplicity in mind.

Submit and Review: Once the form is filled out, applicants can submit it electronically. Administrators will then review the applications in a timely manner.

Licensing and Maintenance: UJ CBE has the option to license this system to other faculties, generating income for the institution. We also ensure the system's maintainability to provide continuous support and updates.
